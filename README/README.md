# README

# This code was part of a project where one could program a bot to download all the images on a page, and then submit it
# to reddit.com/r/photographs so as to get feedback on a set of photographs that you may have taken (and get said feedback
# automatically).

Currently, the state of this project is as follows.

(-) The code in this repository will automatically download all the images on a particular reddit.com/r/photographs page.

(-) Before you run the code, make sure you update the URL in line xx with the right URL.

(xx = 12)

(-) This project was based on a comment on reddit.com/r/photographs. I could easily program the bot to download the 
    images on a page AND upload it to reddit.com/r/photographs so as to automatically get feedback on a photograph or 
    a set of photographs. But I don't want to do it because it may annoy the moderators on /r/photographs.

NOTE:

Right now, xx is 12. Just go to that line number and look around & you will find a line of code that looks like this:

$$$ site = 'https://www.reddit.com/r/photographs/comments/ai0rol/while_i_was_in_amsterdam/'

Replace the URL here with your own URL.
