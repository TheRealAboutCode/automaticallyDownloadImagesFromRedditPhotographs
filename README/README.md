# README

The code in this repository will automatically download all the images on a particular reddit.com/r/photographs page.

Before you run the code, make sure you update the URL in line xx with the right URL.

xx = 12

NOTE:

Right now, xx is 12. Just go to that line number and look around & you will find a line of code that looks like this:

$$$ site = 'https://www.reddit.com/r/photographs/comments/ai0rol/while_i_was_in_amsterdam/'

Replace the URL here with your own URL.
